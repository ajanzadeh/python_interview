Problem: Package dependencies

There are a lot of different ways to install packages on different operating systems.
One thing that most of them have in common is a way to handle dependencies.
When one package depends on another package the dependency must be installed first.

The following text file lists packages (A,B,C,..etc) followed by their corresponding package dependencies.

example: deps.txt

A:D,B
B:C,E
C:D,E

First task is we read in the file, populating a data structure where
keys are the package names and the values are an array of dependencies

deps = {
"A" : ["D","B"],
"B" : ["C", "E"],
"C" : ["D", "E"]
}


Next is to build the dependency management part of a package manager.
For example, to install package C you must also install package D and E.
Write a function get_deps() that given a package name returns a list of package dependencies. 

def b:
b
